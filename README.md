# Vue Star-Rating

This is a sample Vue project, built around a StarRating component which displays stars and half-stars based on the inputs you give it, similar to what you might see on Amazon or other ecommerce websites.

## Install
```
git clone https://github.com/Jantho1990/vue-star-rating.git vue-star-rating
cd vue-star-rating
npm install
npm start
```

This should open a page on your browser to the demo app. If not, you should be able to access it via `localhost:3000`.

## How To Use
Change the inputs via the inputs section:
- `Rating` changes the actual rating.
- `Min Rating` sets the lower limit for a rating.
- `Max Rating` sets the upper limit for a rating.
- `Star Ratio` sets how many rating points are required to add a star.

Updating the input values should show in the field of stars below the Vue logo. Visually, increments only occur in half-stars, but you can set the rating to anything you want.

## I Want To Use This In A Real App
This is just a sample project. It was not designed for inclusion in a real app. That said, if it inspires you, that's awesome!
